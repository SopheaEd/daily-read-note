__Neoclassical economics__
```
Neoclassical economics is a school of thought within mainstream economics that focuses on how supply and demand interact to determine prices and quantities in a market. It's a dominant approach in microeconomics, and it has significantly influenced how economists think about things like production, consumption, and market efficiency.
Here are some of the key ideas that characterize neoclassical economics:
 * Rationality: Neoclassical economics assumes that individuals are rational actors who make decisions to maximize their own utility (satisfaction) or profit. This means people are generally assumed to weigh costs and benefits when making choices.
 * Marginalism: This concept emphasizes that economic decisions are made "at the margin." For example, consumers decide whether to buy one more unit of a good based on the additional satisfaction (marginal utility) they'll get from it, compared to the additional cost.
 * Market equilibrium: Neoclassical economics is very concerned with how markets reach a state of equilibrium, where supply and demand are balanced. This equilibrium price and quantity are seen as efficiently allocating resources.
 * Utility maximization: Consumers are assumed to aim to maximize their utility, given their budget constraints.
 * Profit maximization: Firms are assumed to aim to maximize their profits, given the costs of production and the market price of their output.
How it differs from classical economics:
Neoclassical economics built upon earlier "classical" economic thought, but it introduced some key changes. One important difference is how value is determined. Classical economists often focused on the cost of production (e.g., the labor involved) as the source of value. Neoclassical economists, however, emphasize the role of consumer preferences and the "marginal utility" derived from consuming goods and services.
Criticisms and limitations:
Neoclassical economics has faced various criticisms:
 * Oversimplification: Critics argue that its assumptions about rationality and perfect information don't accurately reflect real-world behavior.
 * Distribution of income: Some argue that it doesn't adequately address issues of income inequality and how wealth is distributed.
 * Market failures: It can struggle to explain situations where markets don't work efficiently, such as when there are externalities (like pollution) or public goods.
Despite these criticisms, neoclassical economics remains a fundamental framework for understanding many economic concepts and issues. It provides a basis for analyzing markets, predicting how prices and quantities might change, and evaluating the potential impacts of economic policies.
